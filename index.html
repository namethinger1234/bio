      <h3>The Benevolent Leader</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
         <div class="p1"
         <span>In recent times, I have been enveloped in a world of the development of arcana and spectral beings. The world in which no mundane object is quite so, and misfortune may await you at every opportunity. The painful taint of the eldritch swarm, the very lack of sustenance for my weary limbs, the everyday struggle to acquire previously unforeseen knowledge of past civilizations. However, without the benevolent leader, I could have never imagined the possibility of a past civilization, nor the eldritch, nor the most basic of the most basic magic …er arcane ability. You see, at my first introduction to this world, I was quite the unenriched being of two-dimensional thoughts. I thought of the land and the shapes upon it as mere objects of varying malleability and no greater. Nothing hidden. Nothing out of site. However, that all changed when the fire nation attacked. I would spend my time roaming mindlessly, meddling with such mundane affairs as machines, metallurgy, and mining. There would be hours in which I would lie under the sun just wondering why was I here? What was I sent to this world, void of others like me, to accomplish?</span>

         <div class=p2>
            <span> 
            Of course, there were the remnants of past civilizations, but they were in complete ruin, no sign of life anywhere. They were merely relics of a past time, wiped out by some force unbeknownst to me. Or so I thought. One day as I was searching an abandoned water home, I noticed some strange lights illuminating the cracks in the walls. I was curious so I decided to smash the wall with the axe I had in my backpack to reveal a sight I had never seen before. It was a very dark table, embroidered with diamonds, and strangest of all, it had a book floating in the air above it that was engraved with a cryptic language. It was very intriguing to me so I decided to take it home with me for further studies.</span>
          </div>
         <div class="p3">
         <span>Upon returning, I promptly opened up the ancient book, and came upon an even greater discovery. I could read the glyphs. I did not understand how it was possible, but I was able to read the writing, and it said “Placeth thine mundane items onto this here table, and they shall become enchanted with thine bleesing of the gods” I promptly placed my sword onto the altar and a beam of light shot from it, requiring me to squint my eyes. However, when the light stopped I gazed upon the sword and no change had been made to it, no blessing of the gods or anything. I slammed the book in frustration. What did I need to accomplish? To achieve? Yes achievement was what I required, but what achievement. This I pondered for days with no progress until I heard a bellowing voice in the sky on one fateful day. “I WILL ALLOW YOU THIS ONE TIME” I looked into the sky as a light appeared from the clouds. Another being like me? No this one was special, he had a certain aura of wisdom about him, but as it had been many days since the table incedent, I was unsure of what he was referencing until suddenly the table began glowing once again with my sword still upon it, even brighter than ever before. Then, I myself began to glow with power. I knew this was it! This benevolent being had cured my lack of achievement and allowed me to ascend to the next level.</span>

         <div class="p4">   
         Then in the corner of my eye I read, "Jamie Armstrong has left the game." Also if I didn't make it clear this was just a game of Minecraft where Jamie let me get the achievement for enchanting something because it was glitched. Get pranked.
